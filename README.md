# Beplus

This is an interpreter in development, most features do not work as of yet.

## Installation

The project is packaged using CMake, so it should be compilable on every major platform.

### Linux

* Clone this repository
* Create another directory for building (e.g. `mkdir build` in the project directory)
* Run CMake (`cmake ..`)
* Run the resulting Makefile (`make`)
* Run the Beplus interpreter (`./beplus`)

## Usage

You may either run the interpreter in REPL mode, or you can supply a filename as an argument.
This file will then be parsed and ran with the interpreter.
